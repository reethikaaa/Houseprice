# Houseprice classification
A machine learning model that classifies house prices based on features like location, area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, garage, pool, and more. Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

🚀 Features

->Data Preprocessing – Cleans and prepares real estate data.

->Feature Engineering – Uses key attributes like location, size, rooms, and amenities.

->ML Model Training – Implements classification models (Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

->Prediction & Evaluation – Predicts house price categories and evaluates model accuracy.

->Visualization – Generates graphs and charts for insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack

->Programming Language: Python

->Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

->ML Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
